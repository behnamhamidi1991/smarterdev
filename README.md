Project Technologies:

- React Router Dom
- useContext
- json-server & concurrently
- modular css

Features I need to add:

- Page Routing
- Shopping Cart
- Search bar
- A modal about discounts and offers by the time page loads
- Pagination

What's left of the project:

- The design of the footer must be finished.
- The SearchBar's functionality must be done.
- Blog's bug in UI design must be done.

* Finally review the whole project and close make a demo out of it. Deploy it to vercel and close the case.

- You must make some challenges out of this project and refactor the codes later. It must be done with reducers and cleaner contextApi.
